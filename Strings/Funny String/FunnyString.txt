Suppose you have a String,S, of length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1. You also have some String,R, that is the reverse 
of String S. S is funny if the condition|S[i]-S[i-1]| = |R[i]-R[i-1]| is true for every character i from 1 to N-1.

Note: For some String S, S[i] denotes the ASCII value of the ith 0-indexed character in S. The absolute value of an 
integer,x, is written as |x|.

Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T(the number of test cases). 
Each line i of the Tsubsequent lines contain a string,S.

Output Format
For each String S (where ), print whether it is  or  on a new line.
