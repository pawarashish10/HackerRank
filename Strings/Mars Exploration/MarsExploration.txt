Sami's spaceship crashed on Mars! She sends n sequential SOS messages to Earth for help.

Letters in some of the SOS messages are altered by cosmic radiation during transmission. Given the signal received 
by Earth as a string,S, determine how many letters of Sami's SOS have been changed by radiation.

Input Format

There is one line of input: a single string,S.

Note: As the original message is just SOS repeated n times, S's length will be a multiple of 3.

Output Format

Print the number of letters in Sami's message that were altered by cosmic radiation.

Sample Input 0

Explanation
Sample 0
S = SOSSPSSQSSOR, and signal length |S| = 12. Sami sent 4 SOS messages (i.e.:12/3=4 ).

Expected signal: SOSSOSSOSSOS
Recieved signal: SOSSPSSQSSOR

We print the number of changed letters, which is .

Sample 1

 = SOSSOT, and signal length . Sami sent  SOS messages (i.e.: ).

Expected Signal: SOSSOS 
Received Signal: SOSSOT

We print the number of changed letters, which is .
