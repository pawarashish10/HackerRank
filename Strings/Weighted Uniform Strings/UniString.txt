A weighted string is a string of lowercase English letters where each letter has a weight in the inclusive range from 1 to 26,

We define the following terms:

The weight of a string is the sum of the weights of all the string's characters. 
A uniform string is a string consisting of a single character repeated zero or more times. For example, ccc and a are 
uniform strings, but bcb and cd are not (i.e., they consist of more than one distinct character).
Given a string, S, let U be the set of weights for all possible uniform substrings (contiguous) of 
string . You have to answer  queries, where each query i consists of a single integer, xi. 
For each query, print Yes on a new line if xi is subset of U; otherwise, print No instead.

Note: The  symbol denotes that  is an element of set .

Input Format

The first line contains a string denoting S (the original string). 
The second line contains an integer denoting n (the number of queries). 
Each line i of the i subsequent lines contains an integer denoting xi (the weight of a uniform subtring of S that may or may not exist).

Output Format
Print n lines. For each query, print Yes on a new line if xi is subset of U; otherwise, print No instead.
